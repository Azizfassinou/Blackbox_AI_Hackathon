## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot Didn't Run?

**Check Actions Tab:**
- Go to: https://github.com/Azizfassinou/Blackbox_AI_Hackathon/actions
- Look for "PR Review Bot" workflow
- Click to see logs

**Common Issues:**

1. **Workflow not found**
   - Ensure `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` exists in main branch
   - Check: https://github.com/Azizfassinou/Blackbox_AI_Hackathon/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr-review.yml

2. **Permission denied**
   - Go to: Settings → Actions → General
   - Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Secrets not configured**
   - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add `BLACKBOX_API_KEY` secret
   - Value: `sk-zduYOC3n0GcsEQnyjNrnvg`

### No Comments Posted?

**Check workflow logs for errors:**
```bash
# Look for these in the logs:
✓ "Starting PR review for PR #X"
✓ "Found X changed files"
✓ "Analyzing file: test_code_with_issues.py"
✓ "Posted comment on test_code_with_issues.py:X"
✓ "Posted summary comment"
```

**If you see errors:**
- Check the error message in logs
- Verify BLACKBOX_API_KEY is set correctly
- Ensure workflow has write permissions
