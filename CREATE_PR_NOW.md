## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot Didn't Run?

**Check:**
1. Workflow file exists in main branch: `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`
2. Actions are enabled: Settings → Actions → Allow all actions
3. Workflow has permissions: Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions → Read and write

**Fix:**
```bash
# Ensure workflow is in main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
ls -la .github/workflows/pr-review.yml

# If missing, copy it
cp .github/workflows/pr-review.yml /path/to/main/branch/
git add .github/workflows/pr-review.yml
git commit -m "Add PR review workflow"
git push origin main
```

### No Comments Posted?

**Check workflow logs:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on latest "PR Review Bot" run
3. Look for errors in logs

**Common issues:**
- Permissions: Workflow needs write access to PRs
- Configuration: Check `.pr-review-bot.json` settings
- Files ignored: Check `ignore_patterns` in config

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

Your bot is working if:
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully (green checkmark)
- ✅ 30+ issues detected
- ✅ Inline comments posted on problematic lines
- ✅ Summary comment includes statistics
- ✅ Security issues marked as Critical/High
- ✅ Suggestions are actionable
- ✅ CWE references included

---
